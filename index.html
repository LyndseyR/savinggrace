          <h3>Why adoption?</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Dogs at Saving Grace are selected from local shelters where lack of kennel space keeps animals from being placed up for adoption. All dogs are evaluated for temperament and suitability as a family pet.</p>

          <h3>Saving Grace Program</h3>
          <br>
          <p>The evaluation continues when the dog is brought into the Saving Grace program. They have access to lots of fresh air and space to run and play together with other dogs. We observe their interaction with new dogs and people on a daily basis</p>

        <p>Bumper is one special dude! He has limited vision, most likely born with vision impairment but that does not stop him from having a great time and loving every day. He has a goofy personality and is determined to make everyone his friend. He is about 1 year old and weighs about 65lbs. Bumper is a very happy dog and truly has a zest for life no matter what each day throws his way. He is a lab mix, a handsome guy for sure and he knows it. His front legs are a little shorter than his rear which makes for an uneven gate but that only adds to his character. Bumper is good in his crate, he does best in a familiar environment and once he knows his territory, gets around just fine. He plays hard with other dogs and is a good playmate for bigger dogs who donât mind wrestling with a big goof ball. If you are looking for a good time, call Bumper! He is always ready to make a new friend and you will not be sorry. If interested in meeting Bumper, please email an adoption request to Saving Grace. He is available for an adoption fee of $350 that includes his vaccines, microchip, neuter and monthly preventatives. Bumper is always the life of the party and is ready to bring his happiness to your home! </p>
